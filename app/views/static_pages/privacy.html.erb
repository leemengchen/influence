You may optionally provide us with additional profile information, including a short bio, location, profile picture and other information (collectively “Personal Information”). You may update or modify your profile information and contact information at any time. Profile information may be available publicly on our Services, such as on your profile page. In addition to using your contact information to create your account, we may use this information to send you information about our Services, respond to your requests and facilitate use of the Services. We may use your name, email address and other information you provide to notify you of new products, releases, service notifications, events and to solicit your feedback and input. We may also use your Personal Information to send you marketing materials or newsletters and to improve the Services.

We may keep a record of your communications with us and use the contents of those communications for any purpose.

Links: We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, for example to provide relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.

Cookies: Like many websites, we use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. InstaBrand may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. If you do not want cookies from InstaBrand or other websites, you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.

InstaBrand uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them.

When You Make A Purchase or Receive Payment: When you send or receive payment through our Services, InstaBrand (or a third party service provider) collects payment information including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, shipping address and billing address (“Payment Information”). Any time Payment Information is collected, it will be used only to process the payment transaction, and will be handled securely using commercial encryption practices. To facilitate future payment transactions on our Services, we (or a third party service provider) may store your Payment Information, excluding CVV code, and shipping address, which you can remove from your account at any time. We consider your Payment Information private and do not make such information public. We collect and store information created by payment transactions made on our Services.

Affiliated Sites: We offer some of our Services in connection with other third parties, and Personal Information that your provide to those third parties may be sent to InstaBrand in order to deliver the service. We process your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, however, such third parties may have different privacy practices. Therefore, we encourage you to read their privacy polices prior to disclosing any Personal Information.

Your Consent: We may share or disclose your Personal Information at your direction or with your consent, such as when you choose to publicly post information to your profile or update your profile information.

2.    Service Providers: We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns.

Our Policy Towards Children

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) protects the online privacy of children under thirteen (13) years of age.  Our Services are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13).  If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal information without his or her consent, please contact us at help@instabrand.com. We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from children under 13, unless or except as permitted by law.  If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account unless we receive verifiable parental consent.  We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information to us without their parent’s or legal guardian’s permission.

Your Privacy Choices

You may opt-out of receiving email communications and other marketing materials from us (or any third party email marketing service we may use) via link provided in each email.

We do not currently maintain any procedures for you to review the information that we collect about you.

Information Security

We are very concerned about the security of your Personal Information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored Personal Information to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

Changes to this Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy from time-to-time, without advanced notice to you. The most current version of our Privacy Policy will be posted to this URL. If we make changes to the Privacy Policy that we determine, in our sole discretion, are material, we will notify you either via email, if you have provided one, or by posting a notification on the Site. Once posted, the changes to the Policy will be effective immediately. By continuing to access or use our Services after changes have become effective, you agree to be bound by the terms of the revised Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy, please do not use our Services.
